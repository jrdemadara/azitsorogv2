              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The story began on July 17, 1993, when AZITSOROG Trading launched with a mission to design and
                manufacture trend-setting products. From day one, innovation wasn’t just a value—it was the
                blueprint.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  By 1995, the Catholic Bishop Conference of the Philippines granted Azitsorog the exclusive license
                  to produce and distribute the 10th World Youth Day Unity Band worldwide.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In 1998, the National Centennial Commission awarded another exclusive license to create
                  commemorative products for the Philippine Independence Centennial celebration.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The Jubilee Year 2000 expanded Azitsorog’s portfolio further, securing licensing to manufacture a
                  diverse line of Jubilee Commemorative Products—from wristbands to notebooks, clocks, and
                  signature ID Holder Necklaces.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
                Over time, Azitsorog evolved into a trusted provider of Digital ID Printing Systems, RFID Access
                Control, and Security Surveillance solutions, while continuing to manufacture high-quality ID
                accessories including Full Color Logo Pin Necklaces, Heavy-Duty Protectors, and Retractable ID
                Holders.
